# Dice-game
A simple command-line dice rolling simulator written in Python. This script allows the user to roll two six-sided dice, view the results, and choose whether to roll again or exit the game.

## ðŸ“‹ Features

- Rolls two six-sided dice using Python's `random` module.
- Clean and interactive command-line interface.
- Prompts the user to continue or stop after each roll.
- Basic input validation included.

## ðŸ§  How It Works

1. The user is prompted to roll the dice (`y`) or exit (`n`).
2. If the user chooses to roll, the program generates two random numbers between 1 and 6.
3. The result of each dice is displayed.
4. The user is asked whether they want to roll again.
5. The game continues or ends based on the user's input.
